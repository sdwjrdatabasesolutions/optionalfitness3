      <h3>Liberian Nurses at Phebe Hospital Prepare for Strike, Services Disrupted 
          By SDWJR | TBA News Network</h3>
      <p>BONG COUNTY, LIBERIA — Operations at Phebe Hospital in Suakoko were significantly disrupted Friday as nurses and other staff began preparing for a strike expected to take place Monday, raising concerns about healthcare access across Bong County.</p>
      <p>According to reports from the scene, several patients were instructed to leave their beds and continue treatment elsewhere as workers reduced services in anticipation of the demonstration. Some emergency cases were reportedly turned away, leaving families searching for medical help in neighboring counties.

Relatives described confusion and distress as hospital personnel informed them that services would be scaled down ahead of the protest. The situation has intensified fears that the strike could severely impact healthcare delivery in central Liberia if a resolution is not reached quickly.

The planned action by staff highlights growing tensions within the health sector and the pressure frontline workers say they are facing amid ongoing challenges in the system.</p>

      <h3>Woman Shot in Face with Less-Lethal Round During ICE Protest Files Claim Against LAPD – Report by TBA News</h3>
      <p>LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA — A woman shot in the face with a less-lethal round during a protest against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions in Los Angeles has filed a claim against the city’s police department, citing excessive use of force and personal injury.
        The incident occurred during a demonstration where protesters were demanding accountability for ICE operations and immigration enforcement policies. According to the plaintiff, police deployed “less-lethal” projectiles in a manner that directly struck her face, causing severe injury and long-term medical concerns.
      </p>
      <p>Legal representatives for the woman say the claim is the first step toward holding the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) accountable, emphasizing the need for safe and lawful management of public protests. The case highlights ongoing tensions between law enforcement and activist groups advocating for immigrant rights.
LAPD has not publicly commented on the claim, though the department previously stated that officers use less-lethal tools “only when necessary to maintain public safety.” Civil rights advocates have expressed concern about the growing use of such projectiles and their potential to cause serious harm.
