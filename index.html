      <p>Israeli Airstrikes Target Lebanon, Leaving Dead and Injured

BEIRUT, LEBANON — At least 10 people were killed in Lebanon Sunday following Israeli airstrikes on multiple locations in southern and eastern parts of the country, according to local officials and eyewitness reports.

<h2>(TBANEWS REPORT:) Minnesota Mall Shooting</h2>
<p><strong>By SDWJR | TBA News Network</strong></p>

<p><strong>MAPLEWOOD, MINNESOTA</strong> — Maplewood Mall was shut down Sunday after a non-fatal shooting left one man injured and triggered a large police response. Authorities say the victim was shot in the hip during a fight on the mall’s lower level, causing panic as shoppers fled stores and corridors while officers secured the scene.</p>

<p>Police say there is no ongoing danger to the public. Two teenagers were detained on suspicion of third-degree riot, while the suspected shooter — described as a small-build Asian male wearing dark clothing — remains at large as the investigation continues. Officials warn details may change as more information is confirmed.</p>
